**Description:**

A basic minimal dashboard that you can use on your project.

**Tech Used:**

**Getting Started**

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Node.js (version 14 or later) and npm (bundled with Node.js) installed on your system. You can verify your installation by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in your terminal. If you don't have them, download them from the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org/en/download).

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project. Then, run the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/your-username/lithos-admin.git](https://github.com/your-username/lithos-admin.git)


Replace https://github.com/your-username/lithos-admin.git with the actual URL of your Lithos Admin repository if you've hosted it on GitHub.

Bash
cd lithos-admin
Use code with caution.
Install the project's dependencies using npm:

Development Server:
Start the development server to run the project locally:

Use code with caution.
This will typically launch the application in your default web browser at http://localhost:3000/.

**Note:**

* Replace `https://github.com/your-username/lithos-admin.git` with the actual URL of your repository if applicable.
