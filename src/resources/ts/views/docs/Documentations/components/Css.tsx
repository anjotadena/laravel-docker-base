      <p>
        Although we have been using TailwindCss, we also have some underlying
        styling that is written in the css, which located at{' '}
        <code>src/assets/styles/*</code>. Due to some dependencies of tailwind,
        we are using Postcss as our preprocessor.
      </p>
      <p>This is our styles folder structure</p>

        {`├── styles

|   ├── docs                     # docs components related styles
|   ├── tailwind                 # tailwind entry & base style

      <p>
        Every folders inside <code>styles</code> directory contain an{' '}
        <code>index.css</code> that will carry all other css files under the
        same directory and all these <code>index.css</code>will eventually
        import into the entry css.

          If in some cases tailwind is unable to meet your needs, you can add
          your custom css under this folder. We suggest to utilize functions &
          directives provided by tailwind while adding a custom css, such as{' '}
          <code>@apply</code>, <code>@layer</code>, <code>theme()</code> & etc.
