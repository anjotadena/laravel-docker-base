        Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework with predefined classes
        that you can use to build and design the UI directly in the JSX. We use
        Tailwind as our core CSS framework, most of the UI in lithos is built
        entirely with it features, so you can easily update the theme & base by
        altering <code>tailwind.config.cjs</code> under the root directory.

          By default, our tailwind configuration includes every color in CSS in
          order to accommodate dynamic theming. However, if your application
          only needs a single theme color, you can simply replace the value of{' '}
          <code>SAFELIST_COLORS</code> in the tailwind.config.cjs file with your
          desired theme color, using the <code>colors.</code> prefix. This will
          ensure that only your chosen theme color is included in the safelist.
          E.g
        </p>
        <SyntaxHighlighter language="ts">{`const SAFELIST_COLORS = 'colors.cyan'`}</SyntaxHighlighter>
